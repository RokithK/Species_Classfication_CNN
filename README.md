# Species_Classfication_CNN
Your project is a **Bird Species Classification System** using **deep learning** with **TensorFlow** and **MobileNetV2**. It trains a CNN model on bird images, evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and predicts bird species from new images. Visualization tools display dataset distribution and class-wise accuracy.
